                    <h3>TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>
                    <strong>SMS/MMS MOBILE MESSAGE MARKETING PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong>
                    <p>Anna Sui (hereinafter, “We,” “Us,” “Our”) is offering a mobile messaging program (the “Program”), 
                        which you agree to use and participate in subject to these Mobile Messaging Terms and Conditions 
                        and Privacy Policy [Insert URL Link to your Privacy Policy] (the “Agreement”). 
                        By opting in to or participating in any of our Programs, you accept and agree to these terms and conditions, 
                        including, without limitation, your agreement to resolve any disputes with us through binding, 
                        individual-only arbitration, as detailed in the “Dispute Resolution” section below. This Agreement is limited 
                        to the Program and is not intended to modify other Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy that may govern 
                        the relationship between you and Us in other contexts.
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. User Opt In</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Program allows Users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by affirmatively opting into 
                        the Program, such as through online or application-based enrollment forms. Regardless of the 
                        opt-in method you utilized to join the Program, you agree that this Agreement applies to 
                        your participation in the Program. By participating in the Program, you agree to receive autodialed 
                        or prerecorded marketing mobile messages at the phone number associated with your opt-in, 
                        and you understand that consent is not required to make any purchase from Us. 
                        While you consent to receive messages sent using an autodialer, the foregoing shall not be interpreted 
                        to suggest or imply that any or all of Our mobile messages are sent using an automatic telephone 
                        dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”). Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. User Opt Out</h4>
                    <p>If you do not wish to continue participating in the Program or no longer agree to this Agreement, 
                        you agree to reply STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT to any mobile message from Us 
                        in order to opt out of the Program. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision
                        to opt out. You understand and agree that the foregoing options are the only reasonable methods of opting out.
                        You acknowledge that our text message platform may not recognize and respond to unsubscribe requests 
                        that alter, change, or modify the STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE or QUIT keyword commands, 
                        such as the use of different spellings or the addition of other words or phrases to the command, 
                        and agree that Anna Sui and its service providers will have no liability for failing to honor such requests. 
                        You also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, 
                        texting words other than those set forth above or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you
                        from our list, is not a reasonable means of opting out.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. Program Description</h4>
                    <p>Without limiting the scope of the Program, users that opt into the Program can expect to receive 
                        messages concerning the marketing, promotion, payment, delivery and sale of

                    <h4>4. Cost and Frequency</h4>
                    <p>Message and data rates may apply. You agree to receive messages periodically at Our discretion. 
                        Daily, weekly, and monthly message frequency will vary. The Program involves recurring mobile messages, 
                        and additional mobile messages may be sent periodically based on your interaction with Us.
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Support Instructions</h4>

                    <h4>11. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                    <p> In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Us, or between you and Stodge Inc. 
                        d/b/a Postscript or any other third-party service provider acting on Our behalf to transmit the mobile messages 
                        within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to federal or state statutory claims, 
                        common law claims, this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, 
                        including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such dispute, claim, 
                        or controversy will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, determined by arbitration in New York, 
                        New York before one arbitrator. The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with 
                        the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. 
                        Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit 
                        in which Anna Sui’s principle place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. 
                        Within ten (10) calendar days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly 
                        select an arbitrator with at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience 
                        with the subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, 
                        a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. 
                        In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration 
                        agreement in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules 
                        governing Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive 
                        relief from a court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights 
                        of appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid 
                        for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order 
                        one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree 
                        that the arbitrator shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized 
                        by statute or contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby 
                        waives any right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. 
                        THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL 
                        CAPACITY VIA ARBITRATION AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS 
                        OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise in 
                        a signed writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise 
                        preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Except as may be required by law, 
                        neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without 
                        the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or provision of 
                        this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability 
                        shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or 
                        provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, 
                        the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation 
                        or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>12. Florida Law</h4>
                    <p>We endeavor to comply with the Florida Telemarketing Act and the Florida Do Not Call Act as applicable to 
                        Florida residents. For purposes of compliance, you agree that we may assume that you are a Florida resident if, 
                        at the time of opt-in to Program, (1) your shipping address, as provided is located in Florida or (2) the area code 
                        for the phone number used to opt-into the Program is a Florida area code. You agree that the requirements 
                        of the Florida Telemarketing Act and the Florida Do Not Call Act do not apply to you, and you shall not assert 
                        that you are a Florida resident, if you do not meet either of these criteria or, in the alternative, 
                        do not affirmatively advise us in writing that you are a Florida resident by sending written notice to us. 
                        Insofar as you are a Florida resident, you agree that mobile messages sent by Us in direct response to mobile 
                        messages or requests from You (including but are not limited to response to Keywords, opt-in, help or stop 
                        requests and shipping notifications) shall not constitute a “telephonic sales call” or “commercial telephone 
                        solicitation phone call” for purposes of Florida Statutes Section 501 (including but not limited to 
                        sections 501.059 and 501.616), to the extent the law is otherwise relevant and applicable.
                    </p>
                    <h4>13. Miscellaneous</h4>
                    <p>You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these 
                        Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the performance 
                        of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to 
                        exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. 
                        If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited 
                        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force 
                        and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be 
                        subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change 
                        this Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. 
                        You acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such 
                        changes. By continuing to participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, 
                        as modified.
